Day 04: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to **Day 04** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🚀  
This repository features a classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, where the user plays against the computer.

📝 Project Description

The **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** is a fun interactive program where you:
1. Choose one of the options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The program determines the winner based on the game rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beat Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.

🛠️ Key Features:
- Displays ASCII art for each option.
- Provides clear, engaging outputs for each round's results.
- Supports random computer moves for unpredictable outcomes.

🎯 Purpose
This project helps to:

Practice randomization using the random library.
Implement conditional statements (if-elif-else) in a dynamic game setting.
Enhance creativity with ASCII art to make programs visually appealing.
